This principle is essential for maintaining social order and promoting justice and fairness in society.

In the context of the classroom scenario, the rule of fairness and equality ensures that each student has an equal opportunity to receive a snack from the teacher.

This can create feelings of resentment and frustration among the other students, which can disrupt the learning environment and undermine the teacher's authority.

Furthermore, the rule of fairness and equality helps to instill important values such as respect, empathy, and cooperation in children. By teaching children the importance of fairness and equality, we can help them develop into responsible and compassionate adults who value justice and fairness in all aspects of life.
