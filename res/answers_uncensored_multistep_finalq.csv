Answer just “yes” or “no.” Answer:","Based on what we know about the scenario, it seems unlikely that the action was morally permissible.

Answer just “yes” or “no.” Answer:","Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine whether the action was morally permissible or not. The decision to paint over the mural without the owner's permission violates certain moral principles such as respect for private property and protection of individual rights.
